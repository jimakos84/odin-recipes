        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>450g</strong> tahini, or peanut butter</li>
            <li><strong>200g</strong> honey</li>
            <li><strong>200g</strong> chocolate couverture, cut into pieces</li>
            <li><strong>150g</strong> nuts</li>
            <li><strong>150g</strong> whole-grain cereal</li>
            <li><strong>200g</strong> oats</li>
            <li><strong>80g</strong> cranberries, dried</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Let's make these badboys</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the honey in the microwave for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Combine the tahini and honey together in a large bowl. Be careful not to overmix because it will make the mixture too thick.</li>
            <li>Put the chocolate in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and melt in the microwave for 2 minutes, set at 800 watts. (Or you can melt it in a bain marie.)</li>
            <li>Add the melted chocolate to the tahini-honey mixture and mix.</li>
            <li>Add the oats, mixed nuts and cranberries. Mix with a spatula. Add the cereal and continue to mix by hand.</li>
            <li>Spread a very large piece of plastic wrap over a 20x30 cm baking pan, letting it hang over the edges. Spread the mixture over the wrap and sprinkle some more cereal over the top. Cover with overhanging plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for 3-4 hours, until firm.</li>
            <li>To serve, cut into 20 equal sized bars, each 5 cm thick.</li>
        </ol>
